This app reads a file with a list of groceries, counts the quantity of each item, creates a backup (output file) of each grocery item and its quantity, and outputs it on a user's request.
        This program reads from a file and outputs to a file without user intervention. The code has its documentation with the best practices used during the implementation. The code has input validation and is not case-sensitive.
        This code can be simplified and optimized further. Instead of passing function parameters by values, pass-by-reference parameters can be used to avoid unnecessary copies of arguments. 
        The hardest part for me was creating a class and this specific case and making it useful for later. Different data types, such as vectors and maps, had to be manipulated to get the desired result. Stack Overflow, Geeks for Geeks, and CPlusPlus were particularly useful in finding answers to the problems I encountered, thus making them perfect resources to add to the support network. The YouTube channel CodeBeauty was also helpful in explaining some aspects of C++.
        Except for the new syntax, data types, and their specifics,  the most important and transferable skills that I got from this project are:
-  ability to plan and divide the work into smaller parts;
-  create backups before editing the code in case the changes won't work;
- manage the time wisely - make more time for implementing a code than has been anticipated because there are going to be more problems to solve than it might seem;
- let yourself take a break when you feel stuck.
        The code is based on OOP principles and adheres to the best practices. This code is split into separate files with headers that make it more maintainable. There are a lot of comments that make it easier to read. The code is simplified to small functions, with only minimum function calls in the main function.
